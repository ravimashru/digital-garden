```javascript
import abc from "module-name";
```

This imports the `default` export of the module and assigns it to `abc`.

The name of the default export in `module-name` doesn't need to be the same as `abc`.

---

```javascript
import { abc } from "module-name";
```

This imports the `abc` exports from `module-name`.

Only items that have been exported from `module-name` can be imported like this.

---

To import and rename:

```javascript
import { abc as def } from "module-name";
```

This syntax can be used to import the default export of `module-name` like this:

```javascript
import { default as abc } from "module-name";
```

---

All the exports of a module can be imported into a single namespace like this:

```javascript
import * as mn from "module-name";
```

All exports from `module-name` can then be accessed using `mn` as a namespace (e.g. `mn.abc`).

The default export can be accessed using `mn.default`.

**Note:** this is equivalent to `mn = require('module-name')`.

---

It is also possible to merge the different formats:
```javascript
import { abc, def as x } from "module-name";
import defaultExport, { abc, xyz } from "module-name";
import defExp, * as mn from "module-name";
```
