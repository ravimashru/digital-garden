When you try to write as a student that has learned something new and wants to share it, instead of as an expert that knows (almost) everything about the topic, you will feel less pressure to get everything right and include all excruciating details.

Write for the benefit of someone that is new to the topic. Since you just learnt something, you know how it feels to not know it.
